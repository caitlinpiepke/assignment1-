											<h2>Concept</h2>
										</header>
										</p> When asking friends how they think the internet works, most could not answer or knew very little about this "thing" that we use everyday. Every person who uses a device connected to the internet, should, in my opinion, understand how it works. Studies have shown that the "internet generation" still does not know much about how this works. This <a href="https://phys.org/news/2014-11-reveals-people-internet.html"> report </a> explains how little consumers know about the internet. This interactive gallery installation will enable all internet users to finally be able to grasp an understanding of this worldwide connection. 
										</p>

									    </p>

										Half cut disco balls will hang from the ceiling and act as "internet helmets", where the user can enter the disco ball and watch a 360 degree video on how the internet works. Each disco ball will contain a different topic on the internet,  allowing the user to travel between any of the disco balls. The disco balls will be connected together with large drapping wires from the ceiling, signifying this physical connection.  </p>

									</p> 
									This concept of using disco balls specifically was used to target my specific audience, being young millennials. This age demographic tends to have the highest internet use but takes this for granted. Having been born into a society where the internet already exists, for most, you don't even question the existance. Cyber security is something many millennials also don't often care about, which gives reason for this installation.

									<h2>Physical Design</h2>
								</header>
							</p>
							As this is an interactive installation, the physical design is the most important thing to consider. Some requirements would be a space large enough to hold 8 disco balls, a monitor and steps to reach the disco balls. The logistical designs and layout of the installation can be seen below featuring blueprints.</p>
							
							
							<h6>Floor Design</h6>

							</p> The above sketches are to demonstrate how the installation will be layed out in the room. These designs have been created for a square room, with equal length walls. This means if the actual installation gallery space is a different sizes, alterations will have to be mad to the floor plan. You can see below a persepective drawing. The outer walls will be lined with mirrors, reflecting the coloured lights from the ceiling and hitting the disco balls. There will also be glowing boxes used to get to the disco balls. The ceiling railing will hold the cords and disco balls in place. </p>

						</div>



							<h6>Disco Ball Design</h6>

							</p> These sketches show the disco ball design and how it will operate. Will have to keep in mind the disco ball size, ensuring it is large enough to fit over anyone's head. The average head circumference is 57cm's so will have the disco ball larger than 90cm's to ensure a comfortable fit. Inside will contain the hundreds of pixel screens, creating a 360 degree video for the viewer to rotate around inside the disco ball to watch. These two sketches are used to show how the balls will operate. </p>

							<h6> Wires & lighting</h6>

							</p> This image of a telephone pole shows the inspiration behind how the cables in the installation will look like with these wires connecting the disco balls. They need to be big thick cords in order to portray the idea of "internet cables". How they all connect is also important, and creating a spider web of cords is the design goal. The lighting is also very important, hence I have added a second image from a Te Papa installation of what these light boxes would look like attached to the ceiling railing, diffusing soft colours.</p>

									<h2>Location</h2>
									</p>The location of the installation is an important thing to consider as reaching a wide audience is the key goal of the work, and educating more people on what the internet is and how it works. I have come up with two different options for locations which both have benefits and negatives seen below. The final decision will only be made closer to the time of installation.
										

									</p>
								</header>
								
								<header class="major">
											<h4>Option 1 - Adam Art Gallery</h4>
										</header>

										
								<p class="content">Option one is to have the installation at Victoria Universities Kelburn campus art gallery "Adam Art Gallery". This location is suitable because this region gets the highest rate of young adults visiting it, meaning it will reach a larger audience. The only negative to this is that majority of visitors to the installation will be university students, implying that other demographics might not see the installation. The gallery is also not very big and quite narrow, meaning adjustmenst would need to be made to the floor layout. However, this location is still very suitable since university students are my major target audience.</p>

								<header class="major">
								<h4>Option 2 - Te Papa Museum</h4>
							</header>

							<p class="content">
								Option two is to have the installation at Te Papa Museum on the waterfront. This is a much larger space for the installation to go, with a larger amount of foot traffic. This would allow for the installation to reach a much wider audience. It also means I can use a much larger physical space for the work. Te Papa would definitely be more beneficial but would come at a higher cost to rent the space. The equiptment and technology is also more advance than the Adam Art gallery, meaning better chance of a higher quality interactve exhibit. Te Papa also features multiple other interactive installations, meaning my installation would fit in.</p>

									<h2>Colour Palette</h2>
									</p>Although this is a physcial space and not a website or application, colour decisions still need to be made to the space. The colour palette shown below is an indication of what the space may look like. As all the walls are mirrors, there will be lighting above this projecting these colours, with the back wall being white. The cords hanging from the ceiling connecting the disco ballas will just be black. The box steps for the user to step on will also be painted these colours. The 360 degree video inside the disco ball will just be regular colour. </p>

									</p> My inspiration for this project has come from multiple different mediums and categories. In terms of installation pieces, Canadian artist <a href="http://micheldebroin.org/en/">Michel de Broin</a>, was one of my biggest inspirations as he created the worldest largest disco ball at the Luminato Festival in Toronto called <a href="https://micheldebroin.org/en/works/mille-speculations-3/">One Thousand Speculations</a>. I particulary admire this one photo on the left, taken during the creation of the piece, where he is inside the disco ball positioning the reflective mirror. This was the most interesting to me as each piece of mirror looks like a pixel. This is where I got inspiration to use the inside of a disco ball as a 360 degree screen.

							</p> Another inspiration was from a company call <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab </a>, who created an interactive magnetic field installation. This idea was to create a visual display of magnetism, which are normally invisiable to the naked eye and created with a real-time computer program so that the art created can never be re-created. I was inspired by this as I loved the colour palette, as it creates a sort of futuristic, progressive look. I love the general idea of an interactive installation piece that is both informative in teaching about magnetism and visually attracting to the public.

									<h2>Visual Content</h2>
								</p> Since the installation will feature 360 degree videos inside the disco balls, these videos have been pre-choosen. In total there will be 8 disco balls to choose from, all featuring different educational videos on how the internet works. These 8 videos will touch on a variety of different topics and have been chosen from the code.org youtube playlist that was played in MDDN201. Each image below is the link to the video that will play in each associated disco ball. </p>

									<h2>Instructions </h2>
								</p> In terms of the physical installation, it is very important to have a set of instructions as you walk in in order to guide the users through the space. There will also be sign posts next to each disco ball that explains what the video content is, as mentioned in the Visual Content in the above section. the first image below is what the typography instructions will look like when you first step inside the installation. The second image is an example of what each signpost will look like next to the corresponding disco ball.  </p>
